### Predicting Cancer Cell Line Drug Sensitivity with Ensemble Machine Learning Models
#### Introduction to Applied Machine Learning (CS372) Project, Fall 2025
This project aims to accurately predict the response variable ln(IC50) based off of gene expression data, drug data, and mutation data. IC50 is the concentration that a drug needs to be at to reduce cancer cell growth by 50%. By combining datasets that paint a picture of the landscape of cell line-drug interactions, we are able to use ElasticNet, RandomForest, MLP, and ensemble models for this regression task.

### Protein Design and Modeling
#### Rosetta Commons REU - National Science Foundation | Institute of Protein Design, University of Washington 
_May 2024 - Present_  <br />
Incoming intern, excited to learn **PyRosetta**, a software created by Johns Hopkins University researchers. I am planning on being part of a protein design and deep learning project, broadening my computational biology skills. <br><br>

### Pan-Organ Cancer Cell Type Analysis
#### Duke University Biomedical Engineering | [Hickey Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/john-w-hickey/home)
_February 2024 - Present_  <br />
Creating data visualizations using **R** and computational approaches to further the field of spatial-omics. I am building an atlas that aims to analyze tumor progression and interacting cell types in various cancerous organs. I am also synthesizing research in the field of immunoengineering for applications in bioinformatics. <br><br>

### Exploring the Relationship Between Breast Cancer, Ethnicity, and Other Health Constituents to Analyze Accuracy of Predictive Modeling
#### Everything Data (CS216) Project, Spring 2024
Working with a team, I created data visualizations and analysis using a Duke University [dataset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839867/#:~:text=Breast%20cancers%20in%20the%20Tanzanian,in%20the%20white%20American%20group) through **Python**, specifically **Seaborns**. I then created a logistic regression model in order to predict tumor size and did hypothesis testing as well as finding confidence intervals using **scikit-learn**. Utilizing **Python** for [data science](https://github.com/niarobin/CS-216-Project). <br><br>

### Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
#### Broad Summer Research Program | Center for the Development of Therapeutics, Biochemistry/Biophysics
_June 2023 - August 2023_ <br />
"Optimization of HTS Assay Development with Integration of SpyTag/SpyCatcher Technology" <br />
I worked with research associates on this early-stage cancer drug discovery project, intersecting industry and academia. My focus was on protein-protein interactions, utilizing experimental biology techniques in **SDS-PAGE** and **LC-MS/MS** and skills in the protein sciences. Presented at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minoritized Scientists 2023, Phoenix, AZ & gave a [poster](../assets/BSRP_poster.pdf) and oral presentation at the Broad Institute.
