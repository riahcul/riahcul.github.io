### Protein Design and Modeling
#### Rosetta Commons REU - National Science Foundation | Institute of Protein Design, University of Washington 
_May 2024 - Present_  <br />
Incoming intern, excited to learn **PyRosetta**, a software created by Johns Hopkins University researchers. I am planning on being part of a protein design and deep learning project, broadening my computational biology skills. <br><br>

### Pan-Organ Cancer Cell Type Analysis
#### Duke University Biomedical Engineering | [Hickey Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/john-w-hickey/home)
_February 2024 - Present_  <br />
Creating data visualizations using **R** and computational approaches to further the field of spatial-omics. I am building an atlas that aims to analyze tumor progression and interacting cell types in various organs. I am also synthesizing research in the field of immunoengineering for applications in bioinformatics. <br><br>

### Exploring the Relationship Between Breast Cancer, Ethnicity, and Other Health Constituents to Analyze Accuracy of Predictive Modeling
#### Everything Data (CS216) Project, Spring 2024
In this group project, I created data visualizations and analysis using a Duke University [dataset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839867/#:~:text=Breast%20cancers%20in%20the%20Tanzanian,in%20the%20white%20American%20group) through **Python**, specifically **Seaborns**. I then created a logistic regression model in order to predict tumor size and did hypothesis testing as well as finding confidence intervals using **scikit-learn**. A confusion matrix was then made to check accuracy. Utilizing **Python** for [data science](https://github.com/niarobin/CS-216-Project). <br><br>

### Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
#### Broad Summer Research Program | Center for the Development of Therapeutics, Biochemistry/Biophysics
_June 2023 - August 2023_ <br />
"Optimization of HTS Assay Development with Integration of SpyTag/SpyCatcher Technology" <br />
I worked with research associates on this early-stage cancer drug discovery project, intersecting industry and academia. My focus was on protein-protein interactions, utilizing experimental biology techniques in **SDS-PAGE** and **LC-MS/MS** and skills in protein sciences. Presented at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minoritized Scientists 2023, Phoenix, AZ & gave a [poster](../assets/BSRP_poster.pdf) and oral presentation at the Broad Institute.
